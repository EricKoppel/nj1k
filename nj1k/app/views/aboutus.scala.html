	<li><strong>About the New Jersey 1K Club</strong><br />The New Jersey 1K
		Club is a fledgling organization that seeks to bring attention to the
		many hiking opportunities and challenges that the Garden State offers.
		New Hampshire has the AMC 4000'ers; the Adirondacks has its 46'ers;
		the Catskills and its 3500 Club. And now . . . New Jersey's own
		peakbagging club: the 1K'ers. <br />
	<br />Sure, New Jersey's great if you like diners, traffic, and an
		ever-entertaining political system, but don't you ever have mountain
		envy? Ever wish you could climb a mountain around here and enjoy the
		progression of biomes? Ever wish you could break out the crampons and
		ice axe on Garden State mountains without worrying about wounding
		them? Ever wish you could have one of those cool peakbagger decals for
		New Jersey mountains like they have in our more vertically blessed
		states? <br />
	<br />Well, there's nothing we can do to make New Jersey's mountains
		any higher, and we don't have the decals yet, but at the least we can
		have a New Jersey peakbagging club. Yeah, our mountains are less than
		lofty, but we've got a lot of them and a surprising number don't even
		have trails to the tops.<br />
	<br /></li>
	<li><strong>Peakbagging?</strong><br />Some people collect porcelain dolls,
		some people collect cars, some people collect countries they've
		visited. Peakbagging is mountain collecting. It gets you off the
		highest, most notable summits in a range and forces you to go off the
		beaten-path; in New Jersey, chances are these are mountains
		practically nobody has ever heard of before.<br />
	<br /></li>
	<li><strong>How can I become a NJ 1K'er?</strong><br />In order to become an
		official NJ 1K'er, you must climb all the peaks on our list, as well
		as register with us on our website. After each summit you have
		attained, log in and fill out the information regarding your ascent,
		which includes the summit name, date and optional trip reports and
		pictures. At the moment, we don't offer patches or decals to those who
		have completed the list but that will soon change.<br />
	<br /></li>
	<li><strong>What are the qualifications for a 1K mountain?</strong><br />In
		order for a mountain to make the list, its summit must be at least
		1,000 feet above sea level with a prominence of at least 200 feet.
		Please note that the current list is subject to change, as it may
		contain inaccuracies. If you have any suggestions for potential
		additions to the list, or you have spotted an error, please feel free
		to <a href=\"http://www.nj1k.org/contact/\">contact me</a>.</li>
